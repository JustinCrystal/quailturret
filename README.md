-Picture, Bio
	Started in Ithaca (College/NY), both were percussion majors (Aaron was percussion + comp), Nasville based heavy fusion duo, Inspired by jazz, hip-hop, classic marimba literature, bands: snarky puppy, black keys, haitus kaoyote. Aaron's words: "we don't take ourselves too seriously but aim to be complex in a fun a way, we also play with lots of energy. Frame classical training with heavy/jazz hip-hop or punk/hardcore from Gabe sound" - convey this, convery that they've both been VERY active (played a lot of shows, masters degree, Gabe works at a recording studio)

BIO DRAFT:

	Quail Turret is a Nashville-based heavy fusion duo. What is heavy fusion, you say? Think of the feeling you get before, during, and after your favorite roller coaster- hard hitting destruction that you can't help but love. 

	Hailing from Ithaca College in Ithaca, NY, pianist Aaron Walters and drummer Gabe Milliman have come together to create a sound all their own. Drawing from Aaron's extensive classical and Jazz training, Gabe's love of hip-hop, punk, and hardcore, and their mutual goofy personalities, Quail Turret's sound is one of intense musicality and, pardon my french, an assload of fun.
	
	So who does Quail Turret sound like? Think Snarky Puppy, the Black Keys, and Haitus Kaoyote, and check out their EP above.
