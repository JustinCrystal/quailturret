		<p>	Who is Quail Turret? Imagine the feeling you get before, during, and after riding your favorite roller coaster: hard hitting chaos that you can't help but love. Quail Turret is band that makes you think with complex musical composition, but leaves you moving your feet and having a wild time.<br><br>

		Hailing from Ithaca College in Ithaca, NY and based in Nashville, TN, pianist Aaron Walters and drummer Gabe Milliman have come together to create a sound all their own. Drawing from Aaron's extensive classical and Jazz training, Gabe's love of hip-hop, punk, and hardcore, and their mutual goofy personalities, Quail Turret's sound is one of intense musicality and, pardon my french, an assload of fun.<br><br>
		
		Who does Quail Turret sound like? Their influences include bands like Snarky Puppy, the Black Keys, and Haitus Kaoyote. Check out their EP above to get an even better idea.</p>
